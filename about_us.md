Jiaminie — We Build Tech That Works for Your Business

At Jiaminie, we believe in empowering businesses through smart, practical technology.
Our focus is simple: we build software that connects your business directly with the platforms your customers already use.

What We Do
1. Social Media–Driven Solutions

We create custom systems that plug directly into your social media channels.
Not just posting tools — real software that uses your social platforms as part of your business workflow.

Examples:

Auto-responses and chat funnels

Lead capture tools

Order collection through Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok

Brand engagement automation

If your customers hang out there, we build tech around it.

2. WhatsApp Business Integration

This is our bread and butter.

We build:

Automated WhatsApp customer journeys

Ordering and fulfillment workflows

Loan application and verification flows

Internal team dashboards connected to WhatsApp

Custom business logic powered by Meta’s APIs

If your business operations can run on WhatsApp, we’ll make it happen.

3. Custom Business Software

When you need something beyond social channels, we develop:

Web apps

Internal dashboards

Workflow automation systems

AI-powered tools

Integration with your existing systems (ERP, CRM, POS)

If it’s tech that moves your business forward, we can build it.
